Since the authors are concerned here with evolutionary algorithms where local search plays a significant role throughout the search, the term MA is used in this[br]paper.[br]&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;[br]&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;[br][br]&amp;lt;h4&amp;gt;MA (Ong, 2006)&amp;lt;/h4&amp;gt;[br]&amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Generally,MA may be regarded as a marriage between a population-based global search and local improvement procedures.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;A GA is a computational model that mimics the biological evolution, whereas a MA, in contrast mimics culture evolution. It can be thought of as units of information that are replicated while people exchange ideas. &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;In a MA, a population consists solely of local optimum solutions.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;[br][br]&amp;lt;h4&amp;gt;MA (Jakob, 2006)&amp;lt;/h4&amp;gt;[br]This term Memetic Algorithm (MA) was introduced by Moscato (Moscato, 1989) and the idea is to imitate the effect of learning and social interaction during the life span of an individual by some kind of (local) improvement mechanisms (memes) applied to the offspring created by the common operators of an EA.[br][br]&amp;lt;h4&amp;gt;AMA (Ong, 2006)&amp;lt;/h4&amp;gt;[br]One unique feature of adaptive MAs is the choice of local search methods or memes[br][br]&amp;lt;h4&amp;gt;MA (Krosnogor, 2005)&amp;lt;/h4&amp;gt;[br]An MA is an EA that includes one or more local search phases within its evolutionary cycle.[br][br]&amp;lt;h4&amp;gt;PMA (Moscato, 1999)&amp;lt;/h4&amp;gt;[br]class of MAs should be extended to contain not only &#x201C;EA-based MAs,&#x201D; but effectively include any population-based approach based on a &#x201C;k-merger&#x201D; operator to combine information from solutions , creating a class of algorithms called the polynomialmerger algorithm (PMA). However, PMA ignores mutation and selection as important components of the evolutionary metaheuristic. Rather, it focuses exclusively on recombination, or it is more general form, the &#x201C;k-merger&#x201D; operator. &amp;lt;font color=&amp;quot;red&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Comments: The  definition has some problem in that it is both restrictive (in that it precludes the possibility of EAs which do not use recombination), and also so broad that it encompasses such a wide range of algorithms as to make analysis difficult.&amp;lt;/font&amp;gt;[br][br]&amp;lt;h4&amp;gt;MA (Neri, 2008)&amp;lt;/h4&amp;gt;[br]Memetic Algorithms (MAs) are Computational Intelligence (CI) Algorithms composed of an evolutionary framework which employs, in its core, local search components."/>

They are so called because they define neighborhoods, typically based on initial &amp;quot;coarse&amp;quot; solutions, in which to search for optima. Many of these algorithms are parameterizable in nature."/>
