    In an effort to make memetic algorithm more useful in real-world application, efforts have been taken to adaptively adjust the behavior of a memetic algorithm across various problem domains and problem instances, as well as at various search stage. The adaptation manifest at various level of complexity and tackle various aspect of the design issues related to memetic algorithms.
