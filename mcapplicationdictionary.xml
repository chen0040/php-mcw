A major focus of machine learning research is to automatically learn to recognize complex patterns and make intelligent decisions based on data. Hence, machine learning is closely related to fields such as statistics, probability theory, data mining, pattern recognition, artificial intelligence, adaptive control, and theoretical computer science."/>

It is typically concerned with determining the maxima (of profit, assembly line performance, crop yield, bandwidth, etc) or minima (of loss, risk, etc.) of some objective function. Operations research helps management achieve its goals using scientific methods. Originating in military efforts before World War II, its techniques have grown to concern problems in a variety of industries.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;[br][br]&amp;lt;h4&amp;gt;Optimization Theory&amp;lt;/h4&amp;gt;[br]&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Optimization theory is the study of the mathematical properties of optimization problems and the analysis of algorithms for their solutions. It deals with the problem of minimizing or maximizing a mathematical model of an objective function such as cost, fuel consumption, etc., subject to a set of constraints.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;"/>
  <applicationdictionary id="100004" detail="Automatic Programming" parentid="0" description="Wikipedia: In computer science, the term automatic programming identifies a type of computer programming in which some mechanism generates a computer program rather than have human programmers write the code.There has been little agreement on the precise definition of automatic programming, mostly because its meaning has changed over time. David Parnas, tracing the history of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;quot;automatic programming\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;quot; in published research, noted that in the 1940s it described automation of the manual process of punching paper tape. Later it referred to translation of high-level programming languages like Fortran and ALGOL. In fact, one of the earliest programs identifiable as a compiler was called Autocode. Parnas concluded that \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;quot;automatic programming has always been a euphemism for programming in a higher-level language than was then available to the programmer.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;quot;"/>

For each pair of locations, a distance is specified and for each pair of facilities a weight or flow is specified (e.g., the amount of supplies transported between the two facilities). The problem is to assign all facilities to different locations with the goal of minimizing the sum of the distances multiplied by the corresponding flows. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem statement resembles that of the assignment problem, only the cost function is expressed in terms of quadratic inequalities, hence the name.&lt;/p&gt;"/>

Protein structure prediction is one of the most important goals pursued by bioinformatics and theoretical chemistry. Protein structure prediction is of high importance in medicine (for example, in drug design) and biotechnology (for example, in the design of novel enzymes). Every two years, the performance of current methods is assessed in the CASP experiment."/>
